## Instructions

In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with files that contain a JavaScript module and some associated tests. Currently there are a handful of bugs which are causing the tests to fail. Your task is to discover and fix these bugs, making the tests pass. You should begin by setting up your debugger to run your test suite, allowing you to set breakpoints and use the debugger to diagnose the issues. This exercise will be completed in class.
